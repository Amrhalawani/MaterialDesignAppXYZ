# MaterialDesignAppXYZ

This repository stores the starter code for the XYZ Reader project in Udacity's Android Nanodegree.

## Project Overview
In this project, you will redesign an app to follow the Material Design guidelines and translate a set of static design mocks to a living and breathing app.

## What the project uses

* [Glide v4](https://github.com/bumptech/glide)
* [KenBurnsView](https://github.com/flavioarfaria/KenBurnsView)
* [OkHttp](https://github.com/square/okhttp)
* [Palette](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/support/v7/graphics/Palette)

## ToDo List

- [x] App was fully converted into to Material appearance sticking by Material Design Principles.
- [x] Implemented SharedElement Transition between RecyclerView and Detail Activity.
- [x] Added both Portrait and Landscape exclusive designs.
- [x] Used Palette to give a romantic touch to each card.
- [x] Much more effective show with KenBurnsView.



## Why this Project?
This project gives you an opportunity to improve an appâ€™s design, a vital skill for building apps users will love. It also replicates a common developer task of updating and changing an app's design as new standards are released.

## What Will I Learn?
Through this project, you will:

Understand the fundamentals of Android design.
Apply Material Design guidelines to an mobile application.
Separate an interface into surfaces.
Effectively use transitions and motion.

## How Will I Complete this Project?
You will improve an app for this project:

XYZ Reader: A mock RSS feed reader featuring banner photos and headlines. Download the code here.
The app is currently functional, and work in most cases for most users.

Your job will be to take the user feedback in the UI Review node, and implement changes that will improve the UI and make it conform to Material Design.

## Supporting Courses
You should have the skills you need to complete this app after completing:

* [Developing Android Apps](https://classroom.udacity.com/courses/ud853)
* [Advanced Android App Development](https://classroom.udacity.com/courses/ud855)
* [Material Design for Android Developers](https://classroom.udacity.com/courses/ud862)

You can also refer to the Material Design specification.

## Required Tasks
* Download a zip file of the app.
* Read the UI Review in the next node.
* Spend time exploring the current state of the app, looking for ways it could be improved. The app will need multiple improvements. Be sure to look specifically at issues called out in the UI Review.
* Execute the improvements!
* Make a single GitHub repo with your code for the app and submit it through the Nanodegree portal. See the Submission and Evaluation node for detailed instructions.
